# Mobjects
Mobjects are (as far as I can tell) Grant's general class of
mathematical objects.  Mobjects store arrays of points

## Submobjects
Mobjects can be nested in other Mobjects,
as instances of *submobjects*.  This allows for applying mobject
transformations and/or functions to a large group of mobjects, by
applying said functions etc. to the parent Mobject.  Any special
parameters given in the config for the parent mobject will be
digested by the submobjects upon initialization, allowing them
to inherit traits from parent mobjects without re-specifying
all the configs upon initialization.
